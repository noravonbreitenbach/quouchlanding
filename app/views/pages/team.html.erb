        <h1>My name is Nora,</h1>
        <p>I founded Quouch in July 2021 and am STILL working on this
        landing page (2 months later!!).
        Well!
        Now, when introducing myself, I should start with where it all began: My trips and the
      couchsurfing! When finishing High School 2012, I went off traveling to South America. So original.
    I did not have any plans and ended up with a religious community (twelve tribes) the first weeks far off any civilization.
  Then I started to miss beer. I left the long bearded lesbian hating jesus gang and went couchsurfing all around Argentina, Chile, until Ushuaia and back.
  During this time I realized that it could mean the WORLD having an alternative platform, away from an overrepresented masculinity but towards a soft, friendly and respectful togetherness, where hopping into each others bed is not an ongoing one sided phantasie.

  I painted hostels in exchange for accommodation, sold fruits with faces, empanadas, kettles and did street music with a self made drumset out of tins and boxes.
   At some point, I missed my flight back home, discovered my sexuality and ended up two and a half years in Brazil, Sao Paulo, and that is another huge story.

   But all things come to an end. When getting back home, time for university (cognitive science in Osnabr√ºck, hell yeah!), then a coding boot camp, stuff in between such as herrnora.com, dieletztekatze.de and "noraluxx" (youtube) and here I am.
   Nice to meet you!!

        <h1>Jeanie</h1>
        <p>The bad-ass brain- we met at that coding bootcamp, where I learned to admire
          her sharp thinking skills. Analytical, Techy and creative with a background in Fashion, Jeanie was from the
          start the perfect quouch companion (especially because of the fashion aspects! All couchsurfers are supposed to wear
          the most glittery glorious outfits!!!)
